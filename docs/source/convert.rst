Convert raw files
=================


Supported file types
--------------------

Echopype currently supports conversion from

- ``.raw`` files generated by `Kongsberg-Simrad <https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/contact/simrad/>`_'s 
  EK60 and EK80 echosounders and Kongsberg's EA640 echosounder
- ``.01A`` files generated by `ASL Environmental Sciences <https://aslenv.com>`_' AZFP echosounder

into `netCDF <https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/>`_ (stable) or 
`Zarr <https://zarr.readthedocs.io>`_ (beta) files.

We are planning on adding conversion and calibration routines for
beam intensity data from Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs).

File access options 
-------------------

 ability for echopype Convert object to read and parse raw files located in any filesystem listed here. 
 (https://github.com/intake/filesystem_spec/blob/master/fsspec/registry.py#L88-L185)
 OR: https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#built-in-implementations

``storage_options`` attribute is added to the class to allow user to pass in keyword arguments for any of fsspec file system.


An AWS profile named 'ncei_wcsda' must be set in the stored credentials file, ~/.aws/credentials

aws_profile_name = 'ncei_wcsda'
aws_session = aiobotocore.AioSession(profile=aws_profile_name)
FS = fsspec.filesystem('s3', session=aws_session)

Conversion operation
--------------------

File conversion for different types of echosounders is achieved by
using a single interface through the ``Convert`` subpackage.

For data files from EK60, EK80 and  EA640 echosounders,
use the parameter ``model`` to indicate the echosounder type,
since there is no specific information in the extension ``.raw``
that include information about the echosounder type:


.. code-block:: python

    from echopype import Convert
    dc = Convert('FILENAME.raw', model='EK80')  # for EK80 file
    dc.to_netcdf()

This will generate a  ``FILENAME.nc`` file in the same directory as
the original ``FILENAME.raw`` file.

.. warning::
   Versions of echopype up to and prior to 0.4.1 used ``raw2nc`` and ``raw2zarr``
   in order to convert to netCDF or Zarr files respectively. These methods have
   been renamed to ``to_netcdf`` and ``to_zarr``.

.. note::
   The water level should be specified using ``dc.water_level = 'some value'``
   if the value is known. Otherwise, the water level will be saved as
   ``None`` if it is not already recorded by the instrument.


For data files from the AZFP echosounder, the conversion requires an
extra ``.XML`` file along with the ``.01A`` data file. The ``.XML`` file
contains a lot of metadata needed for unpacking the binary data files.
Typically one single ``.XML`` file is associated with all files from the
same deployment.

This can be done by:

.. code-block:: python

    from echopype import Convert
    dc = Convert('FILENAME.01A', model='AZFP', xml_path='XMLFILENAME.xml')
    dc.to_netcdf()

Before calling ``to_netcdf()`` or ``to_zarr()`` to create netCDF or Zarr
files, you should first set ``platform_name``, ``platform_type``, and
``patform_code_ICES``, as these values are not recorded in the raw data
files but need to be specified according to the SONAR-netCDF4 convention.
These parameters will be saved as empty strings unless you specify
them following the example below:

.. code-block:: python

    dc.platform_name = 'OOI'
    dc.platform_type = 'subsurface mooring'
    dc.platform_code_ICES = '3164'   # Platform code for Moorings

The ``platform_code_ICES`` attribute can be chosen by referencing
the platform code from the
`ICES SHIPC vocabulary <https://vocab.ices.dk/?ref=315>`_.

.. note::

   1. For conversion to Zarr files, call method ``.to_zarr()`` from
      the same ``Convert`` object as shown above.

   2. The ``Convert`` instance contains all the data unpacked from the
      raw file, so it is a good idea to clear it from memory once done with
      conversion.


More conversion options
-----------------------

There are optional arguments that you can pass into ``Convert.to_netcdf()``
that may come in handy.

- Save converted files into another folder:

  By default the converted ``.nc`` files are saved into the same folder as
  the input files. This can be changed by setting ``save_path`` to path to
  a directory.

  .. code-block:: python

     raw_file_path = ['./raw_data_files/file_01.raw',   # a list of raw data files
                      './raw_data_files/file_02.raw',
                      ...]
     dc = Convert(raw_file_path, model='EK60')             # create a Convert object
     dc.to_netcdf(save_path='./unpacked_files')            # set the output directory

  Each input file will be converted to individual ``.nc`` files and
  stored in the specified directory.

- Combine multiple raw data files into one ``.nc`` file when unpacking:

  .. code-block:: python

     raw_file_path = ['./raw_data_files/file_01.raw',   # a list of raw data files
                      './raw_data_files/file_02.raw',
                      ...]
     dc = Convert(raw_file_path, model='EK60')         # create a Convert object
     dc.to_netcdf(combine=True,                        # combine all input files when unpacking
                  save_path='./unpacked_files/combined_file.nc')

.. warning::
   The ``combine_opt`` argument used in the old ``raw2nc()`` method
   (up to echopype version 0.4.1) has been renamed to ``combine`` in the 
   updated ``to_netcdf`` method.


``save_path`` has to be given explicitly when combining multiple files.
If ``save_path`` is only a filename instead of a full path,
the combined output file will be saved in the same folder as the raw data files.


Non-uniform data
----------------

Due to flexibility in echosounder settings, some dimensional parameters can
change in the middle of the file. For example:

- The maximum depth range to which data are collected can change in the middle
  of a data file in EK60. This happens often when the bottom depth changes.
- The sampling interval, which translates to temporal resolution, and thus range
  resolution, can also change in the middle of the file.
- Data from different frequency channels can also be collected with
  different sampling intervals.

These changes produce different number of samples along range (the ``range_bin``
dimension in the converted ``.nc`` file), which are incompatible with the goal
to save the data as a multi-dimensional array that can be easily indexed using xarray.

Echopype accommodates these cases in the following two ways:

1. When there are changes in the ``range_bin`` dimension in the middle of
   a data file, echopype creates separate files for each consecutive chunk of
   data with the same number of samples along range and append ``_partXX`` to
   the converted filename to indicate the existence of such changes.
   For example, if ``datafile.raw`` contains changes in the number of
   samples along range, the converted output will be ``datafile_part01.nc``,
   ``datafile_part02.nc``, etc.

2. When the number of samples along the ``range_bin`` dimensions are different
   for different frequency channels, echopype pads the shorter channels with
   ``NaN`` to form a multi-dimensional array. We use the data compression option
   in ``xarray.to_netcdf()`` and ``xarray.to_zarr()`` to avoid dramatically
   increasing the output file size due to padding.
